Built my application step by step as provided in the document.
Steps i took and difficulties encountered:
- wasn't sure if i should apply redux and hooks to the same task management page but it didn't seem logical so i seperarted them
- did all the extra logic and features on the redux integrated task management page
- task data was refreshed if the page was routed/refreshed, so i had to use redux persist which took time to figure out
  but after some research turns out that setting serialization to false in the middleware to the store config was my solution
- when fetching the image from the api, it first gave me an error; i had to add the domain of the image in the config file
